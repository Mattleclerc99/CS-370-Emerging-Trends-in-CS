# CS-370-Emerging-Trends-in-CS

**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**
One of the solutions that created a basis for this project implementation was reinforcement learning (RL) applied to the navigation of an environment by a Pirate intelligent agent. Basically, this project is developed towards training an RL model that learns optimal actions with the purpose of finding the treasure while avoiding obstacles.

The initial code had set up a maze environment and some utility functions for visualization and playÂ­ing with the TreasureMaze class. My task is to implement the Q-learning algorithm, build the neural network model which is the function build_model and design the training process, that is, qtrain function.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
Computer scientists design, analyze, and implement algorithms, software, and systems that solve practical problems effectively. They design operating systems, databases, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and machine learning, among others. They also conduct research with the view of stretching technology, which afterward affects many other industries such as health, transportation, communication, etc. This is important work because, through it, innovation is driven, more efficient solutions are developed, and a structure which sustains modern economies and global communication is provided.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
The approach towards any problem, as a computer scientist, is the thorough understanding of the whole problem; splitting it into smaller sub-problems; finding inputs, outputs with some constraints, which later you should be able to design an appropriate efficient algorithm that solves your problem by finding the various strategies you will take to achieve that goal. Then, you would implement the solution you have designed in some proper programming language, and herein lies the focus on writing clean and maintainable code. This will be followed by the testing and debugging to ensure that the solution works under different conditions; optimization for better performance will then be essential. Revisiting and improving in respect of technological evolution is part of this process.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
Ethically, computer scientists should ensure privacy and security for the end users by protecting information of any kind from unauthorized use or access. Systems must be accessible and easy to use, thus fair in application with no price in biased logic, particularly in decision-making algorithms. Transparency is needed so that users would at least understand how a system works. These would include the responsibility of organizations to preserve integrity and truthfulness regarding the capabilities and limitations of technology, protection against data leakage, efficiency of solutions, and adherence to laws and standards relevant to them. Such ethical values make sure that confidence is gained and equity prevails at both user and organizational levels.
